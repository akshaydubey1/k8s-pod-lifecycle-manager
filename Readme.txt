Creating a project to manage the lifecycle of pods in Kubernetes involves writing a script that will create a pod, perform some work, and then destroy the pod once the work is done. We'll use Kubernetes Python client (kubernetes library) for this purpose.

Here's a step-by-step guide and the complete project code:

Step 1: Install the Kubernetes Python Client
First, you need to install the Kubernetes Python client.

bash
pip install kubernetes

Step 2: Set Up Kubernetes Configuration
Make sure you have your Kubernetes configuration file set up. This is typically located at ~/.kube/config.


Usage
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python project.py
The script will create a pod that runs a simple command (echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 30), wait for the pod to complete, and then delete the pod.
This script provides a basic framework for managing pod lifecycles in Kubernetes using the Python client. You can extend this by adding error handling, logging, and other functionalities as needed for your specific use case.



Explanation:
Configuration:

Load the Kubernetes configuration using config.load_kube_config().
Pod Specification:

Define the pod specification using V1Pod, V1PodSpec, V1Container, and V1ObjectMeta.
Create Pod:

Create a pod using the create_namespaced_pod method.
Get Pod Status:

Check the status of the pod using the read_namespaced_pod_status method.
Delete Pod:

Delete the pod using the delete_namespaced_pod method.
Main Execution:

Create the pod, wait for it to complete its job (by checking its status), and then delete the pod.
